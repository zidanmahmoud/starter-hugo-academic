Based on the previous work of [F.F. Taucer, 1995*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242435677_A_Fiber_Beam-Column_Element_for_Seismic_Response_Analysis_of_Reinforced_Concrete_Structures).

The simulation of reinforced concrete elements due to a seismic loading brings down the cost of physical experiments, however involves high non-linearities. Many implementation to tackle this problems have been established through the recent years. This thesis work shows the implementation of a flexibility-based fiber beam-column element to model the response of a reinforced concrete element under a cyclic loading in the post-yielding phase. The theory behind the element is discussed as well as the algorithm to carry on the solution. The element has been implemented in a stand-alone Python code and in the open-source framework Kratos, which is an open-source FEM framework developed in the chair of Structural Analysis in the Technical University of Munich, Germany, as well as in International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE) in Barcelona, Spain
