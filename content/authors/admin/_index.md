<!-- I am a PhD Student at the [Associate Professorship of Computational Mechanics](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/cm/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), part of a group working on Multi-fidelity Failure Modeling and Optimization for Natural Fiber Structures in Complex Environments, funded by the [International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE)](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/home/). This project is currently aimed to be implemented in the open-source multiphysics Finite Element framework, [Kratos](https://www.cimne.com/kratos/). -->
